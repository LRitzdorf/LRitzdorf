# Hello!

## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student at Montana State University, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Engineering and a minor in Hispanic Studies (with a focus on linguistics).

I've also participated in a variety of research projects, including:
- Radiation-tolerant and obfuscated processor design via field-programmable gate arrays (Resilient Computing Laboratory, Montana State University)
- Convolutional neural networks for self-interference cancellation in full-duplex radio systems (Future Analog System Technologies Laboratory, University of Washington)
- Network optimization for high-performance computing (Los Alamos National Laboratory)

## Projects

- A custom hardware and software stack for advanced RGB LED control, using an SoC FPGA device
  (unreleased, since this was an academic assignment)
  - **Hardware:** Memory-mappable PWM controller, implemented in VHDL
  - **Software:** Linux device drivers for PWM controller and (premade) ADC controller
  - **Additional:** Custom-built device bootloader to enable I2C peripheral access
- [`yagpdb.vim`](https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim),
  a (Neo)Vim plugin for writing [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz) custom commands
- [`GitTraining`](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/GitTraining),
  a companion repository for my introductory Git presentation

## Repos

I also do other things on GitHub from time to time. Here are some of the more interesting ones:

- [`helpers`](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/helpers),
  a repo for random helper scripts I've made for myself
- [`TheJeffDeanFacts`](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/TheJeffDeanFacts),
  a collection of programmer-style "Chuck Norris" jokes
