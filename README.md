# Hello!

## About Me

I'm a college student at Montana State University, pursuing a major in
Computer Engineering and a minor in Hispanic Studies (with a focus on
linguistics).

I've also participated in a variety of research projects, including
high-performance computing at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, and hardware
obfuscation with FPGAs at Montana State University.

## Projects

I also do things on GitHub from time to time. Here are some of the more
interesting ones:

- [`yagpdb.vim`](https://github.com/l-zeuch/yagpdb.vim),
  a (Neo)Vim plugin for writing [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz) custom commands
- [`helpers`](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/helpers),
  a repo for random helper scripts I've made for myself
- [`GitTraining`](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/GitTraining),
  a companion repository for my introductory Git presentation
- [`TheJeffDeanFacts`](https://github.com/LRitzdorf/TheJeffDeanFacts),
  a collection of programmer-style "Chuck Norris" jokes
